# Steal HelloFresh PDFs

I like hello fresh's recipe cards, but its going to take A LONG TIME to amass a meaningful collection with a few recipes per week.

Instead, I want to STEAL all of their recipe card PDFs. This repository is how I will do that.

(Not really stealing cos these are freely available on their website)

There became a lot of recipes, so this doesn't download them automatically anymore. To download them, pass along env variable: `DOWNLOAD_PDFS=1`
